# Portfolio web Python Playwright project

This is a portfolio project created to automate the functionality of the [Google Translate](https://translate.google.com/) website using Python and Playwright framework. The primary goal is to showcase my test automation skills through functional tests that check the language selection features on Google Translate.

> [!NOTE]
> The project was created to demonstrate my test automation skills, there was no goal to cover all functionality and views of Google Translate
